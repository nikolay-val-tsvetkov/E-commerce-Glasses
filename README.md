<h2>Struggles with the Code</h2>

<h3>1. Using Images with Next.js</h3>

<p>One of the main struggles I faced in this project was working with images in Next.js. Next.js has its own optimized image component called <b>Image</b>.</p>

<h3>2. Designing the Main Grid</h3>

<p>Designing the main grid layout for the e-commerce website also posed some challenges. I needed to create a responsive grid that works well across various screen sizes.</p>

<h3>3. Price Slider</h3>

<p>Implementing the price slider for filtering products based on price range was another struggle I encountered. I initially attempted to create it by myself, but the try wasn't successful and I opted to use a library.</p>

<h3>4. Stars Rating Component</h3>

<p>The stars rating component for displaying product ratings and user reviews was a feature that I wanted to implement but ran out of time to complete. I started working on Star component that could render the appropriate number of stars based on the product's rating.</p>
